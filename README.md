# HMWK6 - (06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard)

## Description

This is a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. I utilized Moment.js in working with local storage in determining if a new API request was necessary. This web app also has a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance:
